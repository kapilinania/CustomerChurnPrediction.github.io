## Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn, a critical concern for businesses operating in competitive markets. By leveraging advanced analytics and machine learning techniques, we aim to identify patterns and indicators that precede customer defection. Our goal is to equip businesses with actionable insights to reduce customer attrition and enhance overall customer satisfaction and loyalty.

## Problem Statement 🎯
The project revolves around predicting customer churn for a bank’s savings accounts. We have access to customer information, including demographics and transaction history. The task is to build predictive models that can identify customers likely to churn (i.e., maintain balances below the minimum required).

## Approach 🛠️

### Data Exploration and Preprocessing:
Understand the dataset (features, demographics, transactional data).
Handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
Explore relationships between features.

### Model Building:
Employ machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest).
Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (e.g., ROC-AUC, accuracy).

### Feature Engineering:
Extract relevant features (customer behavior metrics, transactional patterns).
Create new variables if needed.

### Visualization:
Compare actual vs. predicted churn.
Visualize model results.
Libraries Used 📚
Python 3.7

### Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Standard Scaler, Scikit-Learn

## How to Use 🚀
Clone this repository.
Install the required libraries: pip install -r requirements.txt.

Run the Jupyter Notebook (customer_churn_prediction.ipynb) to explore the code and results.
Deploy the model using Flask for real-time predictions.

Feel free to customize this README according to your project’s specifics. Happy coding! 😊👍

Remember, predicting churn isn’t just about numbers; it’s about understanding your customers and keeping them happy! 🌟
